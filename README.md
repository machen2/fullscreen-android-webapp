This shows how to disable the browser bar (back button, url search bar etc).
This only works for Android devices.

To make it work:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Navigate to localhost:8080 on your computer's browser and verify some text appears.
5. Use Chrome on an Android device and connect to <your.computer.ip>:8080. Note nothing is different yet.
6. Add this page to your home screen via the Add to Home screen button
7. Use the newly added home screen icon to open the app -- observe no browser bar!!

(Special thank you to Anthony Elliott for the iOS instructions I used to make these ones.)
